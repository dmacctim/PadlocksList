# PadlocksList

The purpose of PadlocksList is to demonstrate understanding of JPA for my Java II course. It maintains a database of Padlock entities. I collect padlocks and enjoy the hobby of lockpicking. The #1 lockpicker's rule is to never pick a lock in use (barring the circumstance that you may be asked by someone who you are certain owns that lock and what it goes to).
